To compile and run this java application you will need to have java JDK and JRE installed
on your machine. A suitable IDE is advisable to seemlessly import and run the metrics.
If importing from an IDE, make sure to link the external .jar file dependencies located
in the /lib/ directory for convenience. If using command line, all of the necessary
arguments are hard coded into the main method. Therefore, it is only necessary to compile
and run the Evaluation.class and/or Evaluation.java files. Once again it is advisable to
use an IDE as there are external dependencies that do no make use of frameworks such as
maven or groovy to handle their integration.
